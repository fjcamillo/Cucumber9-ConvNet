# Convolutional Neural Network on Cucumber 9
---
#### Brief Description TL;DR
The goal of this repository is to gain knowledge in implementing Convolutional Neural Network on the Cucumber dataset then
Incorporating it with the hardware solution.

#### Description
In advancing knowledge about convolutional neural networks, we must first understand the basic parts of a CNN. In this project we will create a

### Models Used
1. Perceptron

- The perceptron is a the simplest example of a neural network. Representing a single neuron, the perceptron takes in all 1024 pixels of the first channel of the cucumber dataset.

2. 3 Layer Feed Forward Neural Network
3. Convolutional Neural Network
